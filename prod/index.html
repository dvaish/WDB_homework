            <h2>The Scientific Endeavor</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>A black hole is an extremely dense object from which <span class="italic">no light can escape</span>. Anything that comes within a black hole’s “event horizon,” its point of no return, will be consumed, never to re-emerge, because of the black hole’s unimaginably strong gravity. By its very nature, <span class="italic">a black hole cannot be seen</span>, but the hot disk of material that encircles it shines bright. Against a bright backdrop, such as this disk, a black hole appears to cast a shadow.</p>  
                <p>The stunning new image shows the shadow of the supermassive black hole in the center of Messier 87 (M87), an elliptical galaxy some <span class="bold">55 million light-years from Earth</span>. This black hole is <span class="bold">6.5 billion times the mass of the Sun</span>. Catching its shadow involved eight ground-based radio telescopes around the globe, operating together as if they were <span class=italic>one telescope the size of our entire planet.</span></p>
